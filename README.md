Pretty simple terminal style translator!

I wanted to start some python projects. I am using the Python 100 Days of Code to build up a portfolio with the challenges at the end of the course. I wanted to start off small and something pretty easy to visualize and easy to approach so I started with the Morse Code Translator.

The thought process when tackling this challenge was really just, taking the words and splitting it up to individual letters, and then with a made dictionary of the alphabet combined with the morse code value of each alphabet I returned the letter in morse code value.
