Text to morse translator!

Pretty simple terminal style translator!

I wanted to start some python projects to make a Python resume of sort. I am using the Python 100 Days of Code to build up a portfolio with the challenges at the end of the course. I wanted to start off small and something pretty easy to visualize and easy to approach so I started with the Morse Code Translator.


The thought process when tackling this challenge was really just, taking the words and splitting it up to individual letters, and then with a made dictionary of the alphabet combined with the morse code value of each alphabet I returned the letter in morse code value.

I would like this to be translated both ways. Encrypt/Decrypt kind of thing. That is currently a WIP though
